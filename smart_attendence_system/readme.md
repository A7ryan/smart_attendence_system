1. Before getting started ensure you have compatible Python version to use face_recognition library.

2. As there are issues regarding build wheels for dlib and others kindly ensure the library is installed properly.

3. You may check help dir to get some ideas.

4. NOTE: This is a kind of automated script, you just  need to clone this and add your images in images folder. That's it, and run the main.py it will work properly.

5. You dont need to label all images the script loop will work but make sure to name your image well.

6. I have used mysql database in case you are using MongoDb kindly test before using it.

7. Feel free to add your code and use it! Happy Learning...


# Note:

1.  The database name is charusat_students
2.  The table name will be the present day date. E.g. 2024_07_23 -> This is table name which has stu_name (varchar) and present_date (date) attributes.
3.  You can create a dashboard to view student by date in either PHP or Next.JS and it will show accurate data.
4.  In case if you find model accuracy low, kindly use proper webcam or change the dataset.py file to train model's accurary.

5. The demo.csv file is of no use, I had just used it as test purpose!!
